## Description

This BIDS App enables generation and subsequent group analysis of structural connectomes
generated from diffusion MRI data. The analysis pipeline relies primarily on the *MRtrix3*
software package, and includes a number of state-of-the-art methods for image processing,
tractography reconstruction, connectome generation and inter-subject connection density
normalisation.

**NOTE**: App is still under development; script is not guaranteed to be operational
for all use cases.

## Requirements

Due to use of the Anatomically-Constrained Tractography (ACT) framework, correction of
EPI susceptibility distortions is a prerequisite for this pipeline. Currently, this is
only possible within this pipeline through use of the FSL tool `topup`, which relies
on the presence of spin-echo EPI images with differences in phase encoding to estimate
the causative inhomogeneity field. In the absence of such data, this pipeline is not
currently applicable; though recommendations for alternative mechanisms for such
correction in the Issues page are welcome, and development of novel techniques for
performing this correction are additionally underway.

While many common DICOM conversion software are capable of providing data characterising
the phase and slice encoding performed in the acquisition protocol, which are subsequently
used by this pipeline to automate DWI data pre-processing, for some softwares and/or
some data (particularly those not acquired on a Siemens platform), such data may not be
present in the sidecar JSON files for files in the BIDS `dwi/` and `fmap/` directories.
In this circumstance, it will be necessary for users to manually enter the relevant
information into these files in order for this script to be capable of processing the
data. Every JSON file in these two directories should contain the BIDS fields
`PhaseEncodingDirection` and `TotalReadoutTime`. For DWI data, it is also preferable to
provide the `SliceEncodingDirection` and `SliceTiming` fields. More information on these
data can be found in the [BIDS documentation](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/).

## Instructions

### Multi-stage analysis pipeline

The tool consists of three explicit analysis levels:

1. "`preproc`": This performs basic DWI (and if necessary T1-weighted image) pre-processing
   based on the raw BIDS data input, writing the resulting pre-processed data to
   sub-directory "`MRtrix3_connectome-preproc`" within the specified output directory.

2. "`participant`": This operates upon the pre-processed DWI (and possibly T1-weighted image)
   data generated by the "`preproc`" analysis level, performing CSD, streamlines reconstruction
   and connectome construction. Results are written to sub-directory "`MRtrix3_connectome-participant`"
   within the specified output directory.

3. "`group`": This operates on the outputs of the "`participant`" analysis level, performing
   appropriate inter-subject connection density normalisation as described in
   [this manuscript](https://osf.io/c67kn/). Results are written to sub-directory
   "`MRtrix3_connectome-group`" within the specified output directory.

### Execution platforms

This script can be utilised in one of three ways:

1. As a stand-alone *MRtrix3* script

   The script ``mrtrix3_connectome.py`` can additionally be used *outside* of this Docker
   container, as a stand-alone Python script build against the *MRtrix3* Python libraries.
   Using the script in this way requires setting the ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable to
   include the path to the *MRtrix3* ``lib/`` directory where it is installed on your local
   system, as described [here](https://community.mrtrix.org/t/the-mrtrix3-python-script-library/2243).
   When used in this way, the command-line interface of the script will be more consistent
   with the rest of *MRtrix3*. Note that this usage will require version `3.0.0` of *MRtrix3*
   to be installed and configured appropriately on your local system.

2. As a Docker container

   The [bids/MRtrix3_connectome](https://hub.docker.com/r/bids/mrtrix3_connectome/) Docker
   container enables users to generate structural connectomes from diffusion MRI data using
   state-of-the-art techniques. The pipeline requires that data be organized in accordance
   with the [BIDS specification](http://bids.neuroimaging.io).

   In your terminal, type:
   ```{bash}
   $ docker pull bids/mrtrix3_connectome
   ```

   Using the "`preproc`"-level analysis as an exemplar, the tool is executed as e.g.:

   ```{bash}
   $ docker run -i --rm \
         -v /Users/yourname/data:/bids_dataset \
         -v /Users/yourname/output:/output \
         bids/mrtrix3_connectome \
         /bids_dataset /output preproc --participant_label 01
   ```

3. As a Singularity container

   The *MRtrix3_connectome* BIDS App can also be built locally as a Singularity container.
   This is particularly useful for subsequent utilisation on high-performance computing
   hardware, as unlike Docker there are no super-user privileges or user group
   memberships required for execution. I have also personally been able to utilise the
   CUDA version of FSL's `eddy` command within this tool when running on a computing
   cluster node with GPU capability (though this can require explicit configuration;
   speak to your system administrator).

   Within the location in which the *MRtrix3_connectome* source code has been cloned,
   type:
   ```{bash}
   $ sudo singularity build MRtrix3_connectome.sif Singularity
   ```

   The resulting container file "`MRtrix3_connectome.sif`" can be run as a stand-alone
   executable, as long as the system on which the file is executed has a version of
   Singularity installed that is compatible with that of the system used to build the
   container.

## Documentation

The help page of the tool itself can be generated by executing the script without
providing any command-line options. The help page is additionally presented at the
bottom of this README page for reference. Documentation regarding the underlying
*MRtrix3* tools can be found in the official
[*MRtrix3* documentation](http://mrtrix.readthedocs.org). Additional information
may be found in the [online *MRtrix3* community forum](http://community.mrtrix.org).

## Error Reporting

Experiencing problems? You can either post a private message to me on the
[*MRtrix3* community forum](http://community.mrtrix.org/u/rsmith), or you can report it
directly to the [GitHub issues list](https://github.com/BIDS-Apps/MRtrix3_connectome/issues).
In both cases, please include as much information as possible; this may include re-running
the script using the ``--debug`` option, which will provide additional information at the
terminal, and preserve temporary files generated by the script within your target output
directory, which can be forwarded to the developer.

## Synopsis

Generate structural connectomes based on diffusion-weighted and T1-weighted image data using state-of-the-art reconstruction tools, particularly those provided in *MRtrix3*

### Usage

    mrtrix3_connectome.py bids_dir output_dir analysis_level [ options ]

-  *bids_dir*: The directory with the input dataset formatted according to the BIDS standard.

-  *output_dir*: The directory where the output files should be stored.

-  *analysis_level*: Level of analysis that will be performed; options are: preproc, participant, group.

### Description

While preproc-level analysis only requires data within the BIDS directory, participant-level analysis requires that the output directory be pre-populated with the results from preproc-level processing; similarly, group-level analysis requires that the output directory be pre-populated with the results from participant-level analysis.

The operations performed by each of the three levels of analysis are as follows:

"preproc": DWI: Denoising; Gibbs ringing removal; motion, eddy current and EPI distortion correction and outlier detection & replacement; brain masking, bias field correction and intensity normalisation; rigid-body registration & transformation to T1-weighted image. T1-weighted image: bias field correction; brain masking.

"participant": DWI: Response function estimation; FOD estimation. T1-weighted image (if -parcellation is not none): Tissue segmentation; grey matter parcellation. Combined (if -parcellation is not none, or -streamlines is provided): Whole-brain streamlines tractography; SIFT2; connectome construction.

"group": Generation of FA-based population template; warping of template-based white matter mask to subject spaces; calculation of group mean white matter response function; scaling of connectomes based on white matter b=0 intensity, response function used during participant-level analysis, and SIFT model proportioinality coefficient; generation of group mean connectome.

The label(s) provided to the -participant_label and -session_label options correspond(s) to sub-<participant_label> and ses-<session_label> from the BIDS spec (so they do _not_ include "sub-" or "ses-"). Multiple participants / sessions can be specified with a space-separated list.

For both preproc-level and participant-level analyses, if no specific participants or sessions are nominated by the user (or the user explicitly specifies multiple participants / sessions), the script will process each of these in series. It is additionally possible for the user to invoke multiple instances of this script in order to process multiple subjects at once in parallel, ensuring that no single participant / session is being processed in parallel, and that preproc-level output data are written fully before commencing participant-level analysis.

The -output_verbosity option principally affects the participant-level analysis, modulating how many derivative files are written to the output directory. Permitted values are from 1 to 4: 1 writes only those files requisite for group-level analysis; 2 additionally writes files typically useful for post-hoc analysis (the default); 3 additionally generates files for enhanced connectome visualisation and copies the entire whole-brain tractogram; 4 additionally generates a full copy of the script scratch directory (with all intermediate files retained) to the output directory (and this applies to all analysis levels)

If running participant-level analysis using the script as a standalone tool rather than inside the provided container, data pertaining to atlas parcellations can no longer be guaranteed to be stored at a specific location on the filesystem. In this case, the user will most likely need to manually specify the location where the corresponding parcellation is stored using the -atlas_path option.

### Options

+ **--output_verbosity**<br>The verbosity of script output (number from 1 to 4).

#### Options that are relevant to participant-level analysis

+ **--parcellation**<br>The choice of connectome parcellation scheme (compulsory for participant-level analysis); options are: aal, aal2, brainnetome246fs, brainnetome246mni, craddock200, craddock400, desikan, destrieux, hcpmmp1, none, perry512, yeo7fs, yeo7mni, yeo17fs, yeo17mni.

+ **--streamlines**<br>The number of streamlines to generate for each subject (will be determined heuristically if not explicitly set).

+ **--template_reg software**<br>The choice of registration software for mapping subject to template space; options are: ants, fsl.

#### Options that are relevant to both preproc-level and participant-level analyses

+ **--t1w_preproc path**<br>Provide a path by which pre-processed T1-weighted image data may be found for the processed participant(s) / session(s)

#### Options specific to the batch processing of participant data

+ **--participant_label**<br>The label(s) of the participant(s) that should be analyzed.

+ **--session_label**<br>The session(s) within each participant that should be analyzed.

#### Standard options

+ **-d/--debug**<br>display debugging messages.

+ **-h/--help**<br>display this information page and exit.

+ **-n/--n_cpus number**<br>use this number of threads in multi-threaded applications (set to 0 to disable multi-threading).

+ **--scratch /path/to/scratch/**<br>manually specify the path in which to generate the scratch directory.

+ **--skip-bids-validator**<br>Skip BIDS validation

+ **-v/--version**<br>display version information and exit.
